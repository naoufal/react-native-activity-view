## Install
```shell
npm i --save react-native-activity-view
```

## Usage
### Linking the Library
In order to use Activity View, you must first link the library to your project.  There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).

### Show the Activity View
Once you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:

```js
var ActivityView = require('react-native-activity-view');
```

Showing the ActivityView is as simple as calling:
```js
ActivityView.show({
  text: "Text you want to share",
  url: "URL you want to share",
  imageUrl: "Url of the image you want to share/action",
  image: "Name of the image in the app bundle",
  exclude: ['postToFlickr'],
  anchor: React.findNodeHandle(this.refs.share), // Where you want the share popup to point to on iPad
});
```
#### Note: 
- Only provide one image type to the options argument.  If multiple image types are provided, `image` will be used.
- `anchor` is optional and only applicable for iPad. Popup will be centered by default if `anchor` is not provided.
- `exclude` is an array with activities you want to exclude from activity view. See [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIActivity_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Built_in_Activity_Types) on Built-in Activity Types for a full list of available values. **Note:** pass only camelcased activity name, e.g. in order to exclude `UIActivityTypePostToFlickr`, pass `postToFlickr` etc.

## Example
Using Activity View in your app will usually look like this:
```js
var ActivityView = require('react-native-activity-view');

var YourComponent = React.createClass({
  _pressHandler() {
    ActivityView.show({
      text: 'ActivityView for React Native',
      url: 'https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-activity-view',
      imageUrl: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png',
      anchor: React.findNodeHandle(this.refs.share),
    });
  },

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        ...
        <TouchableHighlight
          onPress={this._pressHandler}
        />
          <Text ref="share">
            Share with Activity View
          </Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
      </View>
    );
  }
});
```

## Methods
### show(shareObject)

  imageUrl: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png',
  exclude: ['postToFlickr', 'airDrop'],
  anchor: React.findNodeHandle(this.refs.share),
});
```

### showWithCallback(shareObject, callback)
Same as the above, but with an optional callback called after the ActivityView is either completed or cancelled

__Arguments__
- `shareObject` - An _Object_ containing one or more of the following keys `text`, `url`, `anchor`, `exclude`, `imageUrl` or `image`.
- `callback` - A function with 4 arguments: `activityType`, `completed`, `returnedItems`, and `activityError`
